	<!-- UNITIME: An offering consists of one or more courses under which it is offered (students are signing for courses) and one or more configurations.
	Each configuration has one or more subparts and each subpart has one or more sections (classes). Each student requesting given course
	 has to be enrolled in a section of each subpart of a selected configuration. If a parent-child relation is defined between sections,
	 if a student is enrolled in a section that has a parent section defined, he/she has to be enrolled in the parent section as well.

	 ME: Since UniTime defines a sectioning differently from me (and the norm) - a section is an identical instance of a course;
	 they refer to this as a "subpart" above - their 'section' for me is a lab session for a course -->

				 ME: for my problem, a subpart is a lab session (a course can have multiple labs), and its sections are the different
