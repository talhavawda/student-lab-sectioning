## Student Lab Sectioning with Minimal Perturbation


Download the JAR file (ifs-solver.jar) from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mjL3uRGLy4oHhna0Td66pcuFo515L6sA/view?usp=sharing) and place it inside the following sub-directory of the ifs-solver project: /out/artifacts/ifs_solver_jar/. The JAR file could not be commited to this remote repositiory as its size is above GitHub's 100MB file size limit. 

Running the project: In Command Prompt, change to the directory of the Main.py script and run Main.py using the following command: 'python Main.py'


If want to run the project in an IDE, open it in IntelliJ, and create a build configuration for the Main.py file and set the working directory to the ifs-solver root folder (instead of the sub-folder containing Main.py)
